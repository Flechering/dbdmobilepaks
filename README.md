# DBD Mobile PAK Files Downloads (3.6.2-5.3.0) by Flechering.

This is a repository to keep track of DBD Mobile's pak files from the live version and download the PAK files. I will try to keep this updated every update. Actual paks are not uploaded to github, instead I upload them to MEGA. Sometimes I won't include pak files that are hotfix updates (it's pointless).

You can use these PAK files to datamine with umodel and fmodel to find out information about upcoming skins, characters, sounds, ui, dlc data, maps, and more unused assets in the files.
