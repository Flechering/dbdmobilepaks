# DBD Mobile PAK Files Download by FlecheringYT.

This is a repository to download pak files from older and current verisons of DBD Mobile. I will try to keep this updated every update. Actual paks are not uploaded to github, instead I upload them to MEGA. To download, copy and paste the mega link from a file, and paste into your browser and download from there.

You can use these PAK files to datamine with umodel and find out information about upcoming skins, characters and more unused assets in the files.
