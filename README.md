# DBD Mobile PAK Files Downloads (3.6.2-5.0.2) by FlecheringYT.

This is a repository to download pak files from older and current verisons of DBD Mobile. I will try to keep this updated every update (usually uploading the pak files takes around 6-7 hours). Actual paks are not uploaded to github, instead I upload them to MEGA. To download, copy and paste the mega link from a file, and paste into your browser and download from there. Sometimes I won't include pak files that are hotfix updates (it's pointless).

You can use these PAK files to datamine with umodel and fmodel to find out information about upcoming skins, characters, sounds, ui, dlc data, maps, and more unused assets in the files.
